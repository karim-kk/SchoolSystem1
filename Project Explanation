This project is a simple school system with a local sqlite database. There are 3 main parts of this project.
1) The login page.
2) The admin dashboard.
3) The student dashboard.


LOGIN PAGE DESCRIPTION:
In the login page, the user can login as an admin or a student.
If the user does not have an account yet, they can register for a new account.
If the user chooses to register, they are only allowed to register as a student.



ADMIN DASHBOARD DESCRIPTION:
Once the user is logged in as an admin, they have access to view all the students that are currently in the school.
Admin also can add a new student and new grades into the school's database.



STUDENT DASHBOARD DESCRIPTION:
Once the user is logged in as a student, all they have access to is their own grades.
